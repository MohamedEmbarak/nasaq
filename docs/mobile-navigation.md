# Mobile navigation presentation

## Mobile navigation bar

Use `variant="mobile"` on `SecondaryNav` (React/Vue) or `nq-secondary-nav`
(Angular). Items accept an optional decorative `icon` name from the bundled icon
stylesheet, such as `home-01`, `search-01` or `menu-01`; labels remain required.
Vanilla uses `data-variant="mobile"` and the same semantic HTML:

```html
<nav class="nq-secondary-nav" data-variant="mobile" aria-label="تنقل الجوال">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/" aria-current="page"><span class="nq-icon" data-icon="home-01" aria-hidden="true"></span><span>الرئيسية</span></a></li>
    <li><a href="/services"><span class="nq-icon" data-icon="search-01" aria-hidden="true"></span><span>الخدمات</span></a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

The bar uses equal-width items, 24 px icons, a 70 px minimum height, wrapped labels
and a top current-page indicator. It is in normal flow and does not cover page
content. Safe-area bottom padding accommodates mobile devices; the source OS
home indicator is not reproduced. The application owns route/current updates.
These are page links, not content tabs: preserve native Tab/Enter navigation.

DGA/custom color transitions use `--nq-duration-tab-bar: 300ms` and
`--nq-ease-tab-bar: cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.58, 1)`. Nasaq remains immediate by
default. Reduced motion removes transitions; forced colors retains the selected
top border and keyboard focus. Hover does not mark a route selected.

Source Mobile `8332:24202` → `8332:24242` → `8332:24282` supports color changes,
not a sliding indicator or tab-panel animation. Semantic colors adapt to theme;
icon color follows the label, since imported icon override endpoints were not
resolved. Arabic width differs from English in the source, so no fixed item
width is imposed. This is a source-informed composition, not certified parity.
