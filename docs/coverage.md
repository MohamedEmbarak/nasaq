# Component and input coverage

Nasaq's expanded catalog has **77 named entries: the initial 27 plus 50 additions**. The count represents distinct public components and layout primitives. Native input-type aliases, visual variants, editable blocks, and external integration recipes are documented separately.

This is a defined, extensible scope for modern interfaces and Saudi service platforms. It is not an exhaustive list of every possible UI, an official DGA component count, or a certification claim. [components.json](../components.json) records planned, built, and verified coverage independently for each adapter. [EXPANSION.md](../EXPANSION.md) defines the expansion contract; the [validation record](validation.md) identifies the tested snapshot.

## Catalog groups

| Group | Entries |
|---|---|
| Initial controls | Button, Field, TextField, Textarea, Select, Checkbox, Radio, Switch, Combobox, FileUpload |
| Initial interaction/navigation | Tabs, Dialog, Accordion, Pagination, Breadcrumb, Tooltip, Stepper |
| Initial presentation | Card, Badge, Alert, Table, Progress, Skeleton, Spinner, Avatar, Divider, EmptyState |
| Additional controls | InputGroup, PasswordField, SearchField, NumberField, Slider, RangeSlider, Rating, PinInput, TagInput, MultiSelect, Calendar, DatePicker, FileDropzone |
| Additional interaction | ToggleGroup, Popover, Menu, Drawer, ToastRegion, Collapsible, TreeView, Carousel |
| Additional content | Link, IconButton, ButtonGroup, Chip, DescriptionList, Stat, Timeline, Meter, AvatarGroup, DataTable |
| Platform patterns | ServiceCard, ServiceDetails, PortalHeader, PortalFooter, Feedback, CookieConsent, NotificationList |
| Layout | Container, Stack, Inline, Grid, Columns, Sidebar, Center, Spacer, AspectRatio, Section, AppShell, PageHeader |

Framework adapters render native framework components. Vanilla uses semantic HTML/CSS recipes where native behavior is sufficient, and explicit controllers for richer interaction. A static recipe is a valid implementation; it should not be represented as a JavaScript controller that does not exist.

## Implementation types

| Type | What it means | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Native | Browser semantics provide the main interaction | Button, Select, Slider, Collapsible, Meter |
| Static | Semantic composition or CSS layout; content/actions come from the application | Card, Stat, PortalFooter, Grid |
| Interactive | Nasaq implements additional state, keyboard behavior, or lifecycle | Combobox, Calendar, Menu, TreeView, DataTable |
| Integration | The application owns a specialist engine or service; Nasaq supplies surrounding UI recipes | Maps, charts, editors, identity verification, payments |

The first three types appear in the 77-component catalog. Integrations have a separate boundary and are not counted as implemented components. Native elements still require labels, appropriate attributes, and application validation.

## All 22 native input types

The inputs lab covers the 22 standard `input` type values. They are browser capabilities, not 22 extra Nasaq components. The type list follows the [HTML Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#states-of-the-type-attribute); the Nasaq mapping below is an application recipe.

| Type | Native purpose | Preferred Nasaq composition |
|---|---|---|
| `text` | Plain text | TextField; Field + native input |
| `search` | Search query | SearchField |
| `email` | Email address | TextField with email semantics |
| `tel` | Telephone text | TextField with phone guidance |
| `url` | URL text | TextField with URL semantics |
| `password` | Masked text | PasswordField |
| `number` | Numeric quantity | NumberField |
| `range` | Bounded numeric selection | Slider; RangeSlider for two bounds |
| `date` | Calendar date | DatePicker or native date input |
| `month` | Year and month | Field + native month input |
| `week` | Year and week | Field + native week input |
| `time` | Time of day | Field + native time input |
| `datetime-local` | Local date and time | Field + native local datetime input |
| `color` | Color selection | Field + native color input |
| `checkbox` | Independent checked state | Checkbox; Switch for settings |
| `radio` | Exclusive checked state | Radio; Rating; single ToggleGroup |
| `file` | Local file selection | FileUpload or FileDropzone |
| `hidden` | Nonvisual submitted value | Native input with application-owned value |
| `button` | General action | Button with explicit button type |
| `submit` | Form submission | Button with submit type |
| `reset` | Form reset | Explicitly labelled reset control |
| `image` | Image submit control | Native input with meaningful alternative text |

Browser-provided pickers differ by browser and operating system. The lab exposes native behavior; it does not promise identical browser chrome. Use native attributes appropriate to the type, and check the actual adapter API before forwarding a prop. `datetime-local` does not carry a time zone. Hidden inputs and client-side constraints do not establish trust in submitted values.

## Saudi service input recipes

These are configurable application patterns, not identity or bank verification services.

| Data | UI recipe | Domain boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Phone | TextField with `type="tel"`, a visible country-code hint, and a stable label | Parse/normalize with the application's phone rules; verify ownership through the actual service |
| Saudi IBAN | Text input in LTR direction, with a documented grouping example and copy/paste support | Preserve the value as a string; checksum or format checks do not prove account ownership or existence |
| National ID / residency identifier | Text input with a numeric keyboard hint where applicable | Preserve identifiers as strings; application/server policy decides format and verification; do not use a numeric quantity control |
| Address | Separate, labelled address fields with suitable autocomplete hints and clear optionality | Address lookup/validation and any National Address integration belong to the selected service and backend |
| One-time code | PinInput: one labelled input, paste support, one focus stop, optional decorative slots | Normalizing Arabic-Indic digits is text handling; authentication, expiry, attempts, and replay handling are server concerns |
| Service amount | NumberField or text input selected according to the domain's precision requirements | Currency, precision, rounding, limits, and authoritative calculation belong to application rules |

Keep Arabic and English copy, numeral normalization, display direction, storage format, and validation separate. A successful format check must not be labelled “identity verified.” Use fictional data in examples.

## Calendars and date values

Calendar and DatePicker support Gregorian (`gregory`) and Umm al-Qura (`islamic-umalqura`) display modes. Their values and date bounds use Gregorian ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`; display calendar, locale, numerals, and layout direction are independent. Arithmetic uses pinned `@internationalized/date` with Nasaq's table-backed Umm al-Qura provider; Hijri month starts come from pinned HijriDate reference data. No manual day-offset conversion is used.

Date-only values are not timestamps. Select the application calendar policy and supported range explicitly, especially for historic dates or dates used in official processes. Read [calendar reliability](date-calendars.md) for provenance, range, conversion checks, and source limitations; component support alone does not establish agreement with every religious observance or external authority.

## Layout and variants

The layout studio demonstrates CSS-driven composition through Container, Stack, Inline, Grid, Columns, Sidebar, Center, Spacer, AspectRatio, Section, AppShell, and PageHeader. Responsive values use `base`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, and `xl`; spacing accepts tokens or CSS lengths. Layout changes do not require JavaScript viewport measurements. See the [style guide](../packages/styles/README.md) and the actual adapter API for examples.

Treat configuration axes separately: component variant, tone, size, theme, mode, density, locale, and direction. A variant must preserve the component's semantics and interaction. The gallery is a way to inspect supported states; it is not evidence that every combination of all axes has passed testing.

## Where to inspect behavior

Open the [interactive guide](https://mohamedembarak.github.io/nasaq/#components)
and select a component for its live preview, markup, API, lifecycle, accessibility,
and limitations. Each component has a shareable `#component/<id>` route;
[DatePicker](https://mohamedembarak.github.io/nasaq/#component/date-picker) is an
example. The catalog records these documentation links for coding tools.

The playground provides `#components` for the catalog, `#inputs` for native/national input recipes, and `#layouts` for composition. Read [core behavior](../packages/core/API.md), [vanilla expansion markup](../packages/vanilla/EXPANSION-API.md), and the framework package READMEs for exact APIs. The [integration guide](integrations.md) describes specialist boundaries.
